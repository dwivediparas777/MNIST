# MNIST
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Here we have Keras with basic Sequential model and with CNN for image classification.
1. With Keras - CNN we have received Test Score of 0.02907799239689043, with Test Accuracy 0.994 
2. With Keras - Sequential Model we have received Test Score of 0.05232281187833869, with Test Accuracy 0.9845

In this iPython Notebooks we can see how change in Dropout, Batch-Normalization, and no of layers affect the accuracy and score.
